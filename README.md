# Sentiment-Analysis-on-GIFs-with-BLIP2-and-BERT
This project implements sentiment analysis on GIFs by generating captions using the BLIP2 model and analyzing the sentiments using a BERT model. By splitting GIFs into multiple frames, generating captions for each frame, and ensemble analyzing the emotions, this approach provides a more accurate sentiment analysis compared to traditional methods.
